Exercise : 00
Aaaaand... OPEN!
Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, ClapTrap.{h, hpp}, ClapTrap.cpp
Forbidden functions : None
First, you have to implement a class! How original!
It will be called ClapTrap and will have the following private attributes initialized
to the values specified in brackets:
• Name, which is passed as parameter to a constructor
• Hit points (10), represent the health of the ClapTrap
• Energy points (10)
• Attack damage (0)
Add the following public member functions so the ClapTrap looks more realistic:
• void attack(const std::string& target);
• void takeDamage(unsigned int amount);
• void beRepaired(unsigned int amount);
When ClapTrack attacks, it causes its target to lose <attack damage> hit points.
When ClapTrap repairs itself, it gets <amount> hit points back. Attacking and repairing
cost 1 energy point each. Of course, ClapTrap can’t do anything if it has no hit points
or energy points left.

In all of these member functions, you have to print a message to describe what hap-
pens. For example, the attack() function may display something like (of course, without
the angle brackets):
ClapTrap <name> attacks <target>, causing <damage> points of damage!
The constructors and destructor must also display a message,
